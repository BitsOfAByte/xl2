This is an attempt to rewrite [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) using Avalonia. This is a community attempt and not endorsed or supported by ~~Sir Goatington III~~ goat himself.

## Why?

XIVLauncher is currently split into two codebases: XIVLauncher (Windows only, using WPF) and XIVLauncher.Core (cross-platform, using ImGui). Maintaining two different codebases with feature parity is annoying.

The goal is to rewrite XIVLauncher and XIVLauncher.Common with cross-platform compatibility and feature parity in mind from day one.
